Problems --
I mainly met uploading and updating issues.
Johnny created a new repository and tried to invided eacch of us in.
We created each branch inside the repository.
So while we tried to edit things inside each branch, things will be updated on Github.com.
But after tons of trying, only Claire got it correct with the update.
Mine and Patrick's don't work. Still trying.

Self deliver --
Create personal bio and find suitable drummer picture

Short assessments of group members --
We are trying hard to see if there will be an option for us to make the update happen.
And still working on update process!
