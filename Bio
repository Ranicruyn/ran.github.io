By listening to 80's, 90's the Beatle's music at his young ages,
Ran has a deep understanding on Beatle's production.
As a drummer, he used to do lots of practice on each Beatle's song.
He is able to improvise different groove with correct timing inside one song,
and cooperate well with each guitar solo and piano flow.
